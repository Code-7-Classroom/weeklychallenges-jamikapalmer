    <h1>Very Easy</h1>
    <p>What is the difference between the following JavaScript keywords: var, let and const?
    </p>
    <p>Variables defined with let receive block scope which means they cannot be accessed from outside of the function.
    </p>
    <p>Variables defined with const are similar to variables but they do not change.</p>
    <p>Variables defined with var have global scope.</p>

    <h2>Check console for Easy Challenge</h2>
    <script>
        const newArray = [3, 56, 10, 4, 71];
        console.log(Math.max(...newArray));
    </script>
